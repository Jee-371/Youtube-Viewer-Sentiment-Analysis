# Youtube-Viewer-Sentiment-Analysis

## ðŸ§  Overview
This project showcases a complete MLOps pipeline built for performing YouTube viewer sentiment analysis, integrated with a Chrome plugin for real-time inference. From model training to deployment, the pipeline demonstrates key stages of the machine learning lifecycle using tools like Python, Docker, AWS, and DVC (Data Version Control).

The primary goal is to analyze the sentiment of user comments on YouTube videos and seamlessly deliver predictions via a lightweight Chrome browser extension. The end-to-end pipeline is fully modular, production-ready, and CI/CD compliant.
